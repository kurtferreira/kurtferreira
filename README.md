Howdy! I'm currently the Technical Director of Reload, a full-service advertising agency in sunny South Africa. I oversee most things technology both in research and development to tackle the challenges facing our clients as well as any internal tooling and infrastructure.

Any public repositories are likely to be something experimental I'm working on or just for interests' sake.
When I'm not working on anything urgent, my spare time is spent pursuing the following hobbies:

- Tinkering with a soldering iron and breaking circuit boards
- Game development and systems
- Swimming, hitting the gym where it hurts
- Film and video
