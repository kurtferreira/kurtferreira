Howdy! I'm currently the Technical Director of Reload, a full-service advertising agency servicing the AME region, based in South Africa. I oversee most things technology to tackle the challenges facing our clients as well as any internal tooling and infrastructure.

Any public repositories are likely to be something experimental I'm working on, research for challenges in a speecific project, or just for interests' sake.
When I'm not working on anything urgent, my spare time is spent pursuing the following hobbies:

- Tinkering with a soldering iron and breaking circuit boards
- Visual entertainment and game development 
- Swimming, hitting the gym where it hurts
- Film and video
